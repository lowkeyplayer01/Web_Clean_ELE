        I created Foodish because I used to become a regular at a restaurant
        just for one specific dish. Most websites and apps focus on restaurants,
        but dish-lovers deserve their own spotlight. Here on Foodish, you can
        discover exactly where to go for that one dish you've fallen in love with.
