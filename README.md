Notes on Version Control

Because I developed much of the application locally before setting up GitHub, you’ll notice that the initial 80% of the work doesn’t appear in this repository’s commit history. 
I began pushing changes to GitHub after the peer review stage, and spent the last few days further refining styles and adding improvements. 
As a result, there are fewer commits than usual, but all core functionality was built beforehand.
